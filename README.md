# Smart Contract Management Project: Function Frontend

This project is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to contribute funds to the ATM and withdraw funds from it.

## Description

The project consists of two main components:
- A Solidity smart contract called `Evaluation` deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract manages the ATM's funds and allows users to contribute and withdraw funds.
- A React frontend that interacts with the smart contract. Users can connect their MetaMask wallet, view their account balance, contribute funds, and withdraw funds.
